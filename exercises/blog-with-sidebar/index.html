                    <p>
                        Teen Titans is based primarily on stories by Marv
                        Wolfman and George Pérez from the 1980s, featuring
                        characters, storylines, and concepts introduced during
                        the run, and incorporating a similar group of members.
                        The five main members of the eponymous team in the
                        series are Robin (Scott Menville), the intelligent and
                        capable leader of the Teen Titans; Starfire (Hynden
                        Walch), a quirky, curious alien princess from the planet
                        Tamaran; Cyborg (Khary Payton), a half-human/half-robot
                        cyborg who is known for his strength and technological
                        prowess; Raven (Tara Strong), a stoic girl from the
                        parallel world Azarath who draws upon dark energy and
                        psionic abilities; and Beast Boy (Greg Cipes), a good-
                        natured joker who can transform into various animals.
                        They are situated in Titans Tower, a large T-shaped
                        building featuring living quarters, a command center,
                        and a variety of training facilities on an island just
                        offshore from the West Coast metropolis of Jump City.
                        The team deals with all manner of criminal activity and
                        threats to the city, while dealing with their own
                        struggles with adolescence, their mutual friendships,
                        and their limitations.

                        The first season focuses on the Teen Titans'
                        introduction to the mysterious supervillain Slade (Ron
                        Perlman), who seeks to turn Robin into his apprentice.
                        The second season is an adaptation of "The Judas
                        Contract" storyline where new hero Terra (Ashley
                        Johnson) joins the team while secretly plotting against
                        them with Slade. The third season depicts Cyborg's
                        conflict with the evil organization H.I.V.E. and their
                        leader Brother Blood (John DiMaggio), prompting Cyborg 
                        to form the superhero team Titans East with Aqualad (Wil
                        Wheaton), Speedy (Mike Erwin), Bumblebee (T'Keyah
                        Crystal Keymáh), and Más y Menos (Freddy Rodriguez).
                        In the fourth season, Raven finds herself unwillingly
                        involved in a plot that threatens the existence of the
                        world when her demon father Trigon (Kevin Michael
                        Richardson) seeks to enslave the Earth. For the fifth
                        season, the Teen Titans join forces with numerous other
                        heroes to combat the Brotherhood of Evil, Beast Boy's
                        longtime adversaries, and their army of villains.
