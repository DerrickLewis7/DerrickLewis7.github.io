                    Super Smash Bros.[a] is a crossover platform fighting game
                    series published by Nintendo. The series was created by
                    Masahiro Sakurai, who has directed every game in the series.
                    The series is known for its unique gameplay objective which
                    differs from that of traditional fighters, in that the aim
                    is to increase damage counters and knock opponents off the
                    stage instead of depleting life bars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original Super Smash Bros. was released in 1999 for the
                    Nintendo 64. The series achieved even greater success with
                    the release of Super Smash Bros. Melee, which was released
                    in 2001 for the GameCube and became the best selling game on
                    that system. A third installment, Super Smash Bros. Brawl,
                    was released in 2008 for the Wii. Although HAL Laboratory
                    had been the developer for the first two games, the third
                    game was developed through the collaboration of several
                    companies. The fourth installment, Super Smash Bros. for
                    Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, was released in 2014 for the
                    Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, respectively. The 3DS installment
                    was the first for a handheld platform. A fifth installment,
                    Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, was released in 2018 for the
                    Nintendo Switch.

                    The series primarily features characters from various
                    Nintendo franchises, including Super Mario, Donkey Kong, The
                    Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Yoshi, Kirby, Star Fox, and
                    Pokémon, as well as third-party franchises like Sonic the
                    Hedgehog, Street Fighter, and Final Fantasy. The original
                    Super Smash Bros. had only 12 playable characters, with the
                    roster count rising for each successive game and later
                    including third-party characters, with Ultimate containing
                    every character playable in the previous games. In Melee,
                    Brawl, and Ultimate, some characters are able to transform
                    into different forms that have different styles of play and
                    sets of moves. Every game in the series has been well
                    received by critics, with much praise given to their
                    multiplayer features, spawning a large competitive community
                    that has been featured in several gaming tournaments.

                <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
                <p>
                    Gameplay in the Super Smash Bros. series differs from many
                    fighting games.[1] Instead of winning by depleting an
                    opponent's life bar, players seek to launch their opponents
                    off the stage and out of bounds. Characters have a damage
                    total which rises as they take damage, represented by a
                    percentage value that measures up to 999%. As a character's
                    percentage rises, they suffer stronger knockback from enemy
                    attacks.[2] To knock out an opponent, the player must knock
                    that character outside the stage's boundaries in any
                    direction.[3] When a character is launched off the stage,
                    the character can attempt to "recover" by using jumping
                    moves and abilities to return to the stage.[2] Some
                    characters have an easier time recovering onto the stage
                    than others due to their moves and abilities. Additionally,
                    some characters vary in weight, with lighter characters
                    being easier to launch than heavy characters.[4]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Controls are greatly simplified in comparison to other
                    fighting games, with one button used for standard attacks
                    and another used for special attacks.[1] Players can perform
                    different types of moves by holding the directional controls
                    up, down, to the side, or in a neutral position while
                    pressing the attack or special button.[2] As such, each
                    character has four types of ground attacks, mid-air attacks,
                    and special attacks that can be performed.[2] Quickly
                    pressing or tapping a directional input and the attack
                    button together while on the ground allows players to
                    perform a chargeable "Smash Attack", which is generally more
                    powerful than other attacks.[2] When characters are hit by
                    attacks, they receive a hitstun that temporarily disallows
                    any attacks to be made. This allows combos to be performed.
                    A shield button allows players to put up a defensive shield
                    which weakens with repeated use and will leave the player
                    unable to move if broken. Combining the shield button with
                    directional inputs and attack buttons allows the player to
                    also perform dodges, rolls, grabs, and throws.[5] The three
                    basic actions in Super Smash Bros., attacking, grabbing, and
                    shielding, are often described using a rock–paper–scissors
                    analogy: attacking beats grabbing, grabbing beats shielding,
                    and shielding beats attacking.[6] When a player knocks
                    another player off of the main platform, they may perform an
                    action called edge-guarding.[7] At the same time the player
                    that has been knocked off will try to recover by jumping
                    back onto the stage and avoiding the other players'
                    edge-guarding.[2]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another element in the Super Smash Bros. series is battle
                    items, the abundance of which players can adjust before
                    matches. There are conventional "battering items", with
                    which a player may hit an opponent, such as a home-run bat
                    or a beam sword; throwing items, including Bob-ombs and
                    Koopa shells; and shooting items, either single-shot guns or
                    rapid-fire blasters. Recovery items allow the user to reduce
                    their damage percentage by varying amounts. Poké Balls are
                    special items that release a random Pokémon onto the
                    battlefield to temporarily assist the user. Brawl introduced
                    the Assist Trophy item which serves a similar purpose;
                    instead of releasing Pokémon, it summons a character from
                    another series.[8] Brawl also introduces the Smash Ball,
                    which when broken allows the fighter to perform a character-
                    specific super attack known as a "Final Smash".[8]

                    The rules that can be used in a match vary depending on the
                    game, but the two most commonly used settings across all
                    games are Time and Stock. Time mode uses a point-based
                    system in which fighters earn points for knocking out their
                    opponents and lose points for being knocked out or self-
                    destructing (i.e. falling out of the stage by themselves).
                    The player with the highest score at the end of the set time
                    limit wins the match. Stock mode, also known as Survival,
                    uses a life-based system in which players are given a set
                    number of lives, known as stock, with each fighter losing a
                    life whenever they are knocked out, becoming eliminated if
                    they run out of lives. The winner is the last fighter
                    standing once all other fighters are eliminated or, if a
                    time limit is applied to the match, the fighter with the
                    most lives remaining once time runs out. In the event of a
                    tie, a Sudden Death match takes place. Here, each of the
                    tied fighters are given a starting damage percentage of
                    300%, making them easier to launch off the stage, and the
                    last fighter standing will be declared as the winner. In
                    some games this process is repeated if the match ends in
                    another tie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gameplay using competitive Super Smash Bros. rules is
                    usually played in Stock mode with a timer.[9] Items are
                    turned off, and the only tournament-legal stages are those
                    that do not feature hazards and other disruptive elements.

                    Each game in the series has a number of playable characters
                    (referred in the games as "fighters") taken from various
                    gaming franchises, with over 80 in total across the series.
                    Starting with Super Smash Bros. Brawl, characters from non-
                    Nintendo franchises began to make playable appearances. In
                    Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, players were
                    able to customize existing fighters with altered movesets
                    and abilities, as well as making their own Mii fighters that
                    can be given three different fighting styles. There are also
                    other non-playable characters that take the form of enemies,
                    bosses, and summonable power-up items.

                <h3 id="music">Music</h3>
                <p>
                    Super Smash Bros. features music from some of Nintendo's
                    popular gaming franchises. While many are newly arranged for
                    the game, some songs are taken directly from their sources.
                    The music for the Nintendo 64 game was composed by Hirokazu
                    Ando, who later returned as sound and music director in
                    Melee. Melee also features tracks composed by Tadashi
                    Ikegami, Shougo Sakai, and Takuto Kitsuta.[11] Brawl
                    featured the collaboration of 38 contracted composers,[12]
                    including Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu, who
                    composed the main theme.[13] Like in Brawl, Super Smash
                    Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U featured many original and
                    re-arranged tracks from various different gaming franchises
                    from a variety of different composers and arrangers. Both
                    versions have multiple musical tracks that can be selected
                    and listened to using the returning "My Music" feature,
                    including pieces taken directly from earlier Super Smash
                    Bros. games. The 3DS and Switch games allow players to
                    listen to their music from the sound menu while the system
                    is in sleep/handheld mode.[14][15] Ultimate continued the
                    trend of multiple composers and arrangers working on remixed
                    tracks, having over 800 in total.[15][16]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Three soundtrack albums for the series have been released.
                    An album with the original music for Super Smash Bros. was
                    released in Japan by Teichiku Records in 2000.[17] In 2003,
                    Nintendo released Smashing...Live!, a live orchestrated
                    performance of various pieces featured in Melee by the New
                    Japan Philharmonic.[18] A two-disc promotional soundtrack
                    titled A Smashing Soundtrack was available for Club Nintendo
                    members who registered both the 3DS and Wii U games between
                    November 21, 2014, and January 13, 2015.[19]

                <p>
                    Super Smash Bros. was developed by HAL Laboratory, an
                    independent affiliate company, during 1998. It began as a
                    prototype created by Masahiro Sakurai and Satoru Iwata in
                    their spare time, Dragon King: The Fighting Game, and
                    featured no Nintendo characters. However, Sakurai hit on the
                    idea of including fighters from different Nintendo
                    franchises in order to provide "atmosphere" which he felt
                    was necessary for a home console fighting game, and his
                    idea was approved.[20] Although never acknowledged by
                    Nintendo or any developers behind Super Smash Bros.,
                    third-party sources have identified Namco's 1995 fighting
                    game The Outfoxies as a possible inspiration.[21][22][23]
                    The game had a small budget and little promotion, and was
                    originally a Japan-only release, but its huge success saw
                    the game released worldwide.[24] On October 20, 2022,
                    Sakurai, who still had the prototype of Dragon King: The
                    Fighting Game, demonstrated its gameplay, and its
                    differences from the final product of Super Smash Bros.[25]

                    Super Smash Bros. was introduced in 1999 for the Nintendo
                    64. It was released worldwide after selling over a million
                    copies in Japan.[26] It featured eight characters from the
                    start (Mario, Donkey Kong, Link, Samus, Yoshi, Kirby, Fox,
                    and Pikachu), with four unlockable characters (Luigi,
                    Captain Falcon, Ness, and Jigglypuff), all of them created
                    by Nintendo or one of its second-party developers.

                    In Super Smash Bros., up to four players can play in
                    multiplayer (Versus) mode, with the specific rules of each
                    match being predetermined by the players. There are two
                    match types that can be chosen: Time, where the person with
                    the most KOs at the end of the set time wins; and stock,
                    where each player has a set number of lives and are
                    eliminated from play when their lives are depleted.

                    This game's primary single-player mode, named "Classic Mode"
                    in later series entries, features a series of predetermined
                    opponents the player must defeat. Other single-player modes
                    exist such as Training and several minigames, including
                    "Break the Targets" and "Board the Platforms". All of these
                    were included in the sequel, with the exception of "Board
                    the Platforms".
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are nine playable stages in Versus mode, eight based
                    on each of the starting characters (such as Princess Peach's
                    Castle for Mario, Zebes for Samus, and Sector Z for Fox) and
                    the unlockable Mushroom Kingdom, based around motifs from
                    the original Super Mario Bros., even containing original
                    sprites and the original version of the Overworld theme from
                    that game.

                    A followup for the GameCube, Super Smash Bros. Melee,
                    released in Japan and North America in late 2001, and in
                    Europe and Australia in May 2002. It had a larger budget and
                    development team than Super Smash Bros. did[27] and was
                    released to much greater praise and acclaim among critics
                    and consumers. Since its release, Super Smash Bros. Melee
                    has sold more than 7 million copies and was the best selling
                    game on the GameCube.[28] Super Smash Bros. Melee features
                    26 characters, of which 15 are available initially, more
                    than doubling the number of characters in its predecessor.
                    There are also 29 stages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It introduced two new single-player modes alongside the
                    Classic mode: Adventure mode and All-Star mode. Adventure
                    mode has platforming segments similar to the original's
                    "Race to the Finish" mini-game, and All-Star is a fight
                    against every playable character in the game, allows the
                    player only one life in which damage is accumulated over
                    each battle and a limited number of healing items in between
                    battles. Also in Melee is the Home-Run Contest minigame,
                    which replaced Board the Platforms in the original game.
                    Here, fighters will have to send Sandbag out of the stage to
                    get the best distance with a baseball bat while damaging it
                    for ten seconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are also significantly more multiplayer modes and a
                    tournament mode allowing for 64 different competitors whom
                    can all be controlled by human players, although only up to
                    four players can participate at the same time. Additionally,
                    the game featured alternative battle modes, called "Special
                    Melee", which allows players to make many different
                    alterations to the battle, along with alternative ways to
                    judge a victory, such as through collecting coins throughout
                    the match.[2]

                    In place of Super Smash Bros.' character profiles, Melee
                    introduced trophies (called "figures" in the Japanese
                    version). The 293 trophies include three different profiles
                    for each playable character, one unlocked in each single-
                    player mode. In addition, unlike its predecessor, Melee
                    contains profiles for many Nintendo characters who are
                    either non-playable or do not appear in the game, as well as
                    Nintendo items, stages, enemies, and elements.

                    HAL Laboratory developed Super Smash Bros. Melee, with
                    Masahiro Sakurai as the head of production. The game was one
                    of the first games released on the GameCube and highlighted
                    the advancement in graphics from the Nintendo 64. The
                    developers wanted to pay homage to the debut of the GameCube
                    by making an opening full motion video sequence that would
                    attract people's attention to the graphics.[29] HAL worked
                    with three separate graphic houses in Tokyo to make the
                    opening sequence. On their official website, the developers
                    posted screenshots and information highlighting and
                    explaining the attention to physics and detail in the game,
                    with references to changes from its predecessor.[30] The
                    Super Smash Bros. logo, consisting of two lines of different
                    weight crossing within a circle, represented the idea of a
                    franchise crossover, according to Sakurai, naturally
                    dividing the circle into four sections to represent the
                    four-player fighting mode.[31]

                    At a pre-E3 2005 press conference, president of Nintendo at
                    the time Satoru Iwata announced the next installment of
                    Super Smash Bros. was not only already in development for
                    their next gaming console, but hoped it would be a launch
                    game with Wi–Fi compatibility for online play.[32] The
                    announcement was unexpected to the creator of the Super
                    Smash Bros. series, Masahiro Sakurai. Back in 2003, he had
                    left HAL Laboratory, the company that was in charge with the
                    franchises' development and was never informed of this
                    announcement despite the fact shortly after resigning from
                    the company, Iwata said if a new game was to be made, he
                    would be in charge. It was not until after the conference
                    Sakurai was called to Satoru Iwata's room on the top floor
                    of a Los Angeles hotel, where he was told by Iwata "We'd
                    like you to be involved in the production of the new Smash
                    Bros., if possible near the level of director".[33] Although
                    Iwata had said he was hoping for it to be a launch game,
                    Sakurai stated: "I decided to become director. And as of May
                    2005, I was the only member of the new Smash Bros.
                    development team." Development of the game never actually 
                    started until October 2005,[34] when Nintendo opened a new
                    office in Tokyo just for its production. Nintendo also
                    enlisted outside help from various developer studios, mainly
                    Game Arts. Sakurai also stated that these people had spent
                    excessive amounts of time playing Super Smash Bros. Melee.
                    This team was given access to all the original material and
                    tools from the development of Melee, courtesy of HAL
                    Laboratory. Also, several Smash Bros. staff members that
                    reside around the area of the new office joined the
                    project's development.[35][36]

                    On the game's official Japanese website, the developers
                    explain reasons for making particular characters playable
                    and explain why some characters were not available as
                    playable characters upon release. Initially, the development
                    team wanted to replace Ness with Lucas, the main character
                    of Mother 3 for the Game Boy Advance, but they retained Ness
                    in consideration of delays.[37] The game's creators have
                    included Lucas in the game's sequel, Super Smash Bros.
                    Brawl.[38][39] Video game developer Hideo Kojima originally
                    requested Solid Snake, the protagonist of the Metal Gear
                    series, to be a playable character in Super Smash Bros.
                    Melee, but the game was too far in development for him to be
                    included. As with Lucas, development time allowed for his
                    inclusion in Brawl. Roy and Marth were initially intended to
                    be playable exclusively in the Japanese version of Super
                    Smash Bros. Melee. However, they received favorable
                    attention during the game's North American localization,
                    leading to the decision for the developers to include them
                    in the Western version. Comparisons have been formed by the
                    developers between characters which have very similar moves
                    to each other on the website. Such characters were referred
                    to as "clones" in the media.

                    At the Nintendo Media Conference at E3 2007, it was
                    announced by Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé
                    that Super Smash Bros. Brawl would be released on December
                    3, 2007, in the Americas. However, just 2 months before its
                    anticipated December release, the development team asked for
                    more time to work on the game. During the Nintendo
                    Conference on October 10, 2007, Nintendo Co., Ltd. president
                    Iwata announced the delay.

                    On October 11, 2007, George Harrison of Nintendo of America
                    announced that Super Smash Bros. Brawl would be released on
                    February 10, 2008, in North America.[40] On January 15,
                    2008, the game's release was pushed back one week in Japan
                    to January 31 and nearly a month in the Americas to March 9.
                    [41] On April 24, 2008, it was confirmed by Nintendo of
                    Europe that Brawl will be released in Europe on June 27.[42]

                    Although a third Super Smash Bros. game had been announced
                    long before E3 2006, Nintendo unveiled its first information
                    in the form of a trailer in 2006, and the game was named
                    Super Smash Bros. Brawl and released worldwide in 2008. The
                    game featured a set of third-party characters, Solid Snake
                    of Konami's Metal Gear series, and longtime Mario rival
                    Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega's series of the same name.
                    Brawl was also the first game in the franchise to support
                    online play, via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection,[43] and to
                    offer the ability for players to construct their own
                    original stages.[44] The game features a total of 39
                    playable characters and 41 stages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brawl also features compatibility with four kinds of
                    controllers (the Wii Remote on its side, the Wii Remote and
                    Nunchuk combination, the Classic Controller, and the
                    GameCube controller),[45] while its predecessors only used
                    the one controller designed for that system. The player also
                    has the ability to change the configuration of controls and
                    the controller type.[46]

                    Super Smash Bros. Brawl features a single-player mode known
                    as The Subspace Emissary. This mode features unique
                    character storylines along with numerous side-scrolling
                    levels and multiple bosses to fight, as well as CG cut
                    scenes explaining the storyline. The Subspace Emissary
                    features a new group of antagonists called the Subspace
                    Army, who are led by the Ancient Minister. Some of these
                    enemy characters appeared in previous Nintendo video games,
                    such as Petey Piranha from the Super Mario series and a
                    squadron of R.O.B.s based on classic Nintendo hardware. The
                    Subspace Emissary also boasts a number of original enemies,
                    such as the Roader, a robotic unicycle; the Bytan, a
                    one-eyed ball-like creature which can replicate itself if
                    left alone; and the Primid, enemies that come in many
                    variations.[47] Though primarily a single-player mode,
                    The Subspace Emissary allows for cooperative multiplayer.
                    There are five difficulty levels for each stage, and there
                    is a method of increasing characters' powers during the
                    game.[48] This is done by placing collected stickers onto
                    the bottom of a character's trophy between stages to improve
                    various aspects of a fighter.[49]

                    Director Masahiro Sakurai first announced that a new Super
                    Smash Bros. game was planned for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U at
                    E3 2011 in June 2011, but development only officially began
                    following the completion of Sakurai's other project, Kid
                    Icarus: Uprising, in March 2012.[50][51] The game was later
                    revealed to be a joint-project between Sora Ltd. and Bandai
                    Namco Games, with various staff members from Bandai Namco's
                    Soulcalibur and Tekken series assisting Sakurai in
                    development.[52][53][54] Sakurai, who was previously the
                    sole person responsible for balance in the series' multiple
                    fighters, has involved more staff to further improve the
                    game's competitive balance.[55] The game was officially
                    revealed at E3 2013 on June 11, 2013, during a Nintendo
                    Direct presentation.[56] Along with screenshots being posted
                    each weekday on the game's official website and Miiverse
                    community,[57] various cinematic trailers were released,
                    introducing each of the brand new fighters. Sakurai chose to
                    use these trailers, which benefit from Internet sharing, as
                    opposed to including a story campaign similar to the
                    Subspace Emissary mode featured in Brawl, as he believed the
                    impact of seeing the mode's cinematic cutscenes for the
                    first time was ruined by people uploading said scenes to
                    video sharing websites.[58][59]

                    At E3 2013, Sakurai stated that the tripping mechanic
                    introduced in Brawl was removed, with him also stating that
                    the gameplay was between the fast-paced and competitive
                    style of Melee and the slower and more casual style of
                    Brawl.[60] While the games didn't feature cross-platform
                    play between the Wii U and 3DS, due to each version
                    featuring certain exclusive stages and gamemodes, there is
                    an option to transfer customized characters and items
                    between the two versions.[61] The game builds upon the
                    previous game's third-party involvement with the addition
                    of third-party characters such as Capcom's Mega Man and
                    Bandai Namco's Pac-Man, as well as the return of Sega's
                    Sonic the Hedgehog. This involvement expands beyond playable
                    characters, as other third-party characters, such as
                    Ubisoft's Rayman, are also included in the game as trophies.
                    [62] The addition of Mii characters was made in response to
                    the growing number of requests from fans to have their dream
                    characters included in the game. To prevent potential
                    bullying, as well as to maintain game balance online, Mii
                    Fighters cannot be used in online matches against strangers.
                    [63] The decision to release the Wii U version at a later
                    date from the 3DS version was made to allow each version to
                    receive a dedicated debugging period.[64] Hardware
                    limitations on the Nintendo 3DS led to various design
                    choices, such as the removal of mid-match transformations,
                    the absence of the Ice Climbers, and the lack of Circle Pad
                    Pro support.[65]

                    At E3 2011, it was confirmed that a fourth Super Smash Bros.
                    game would be coming to the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, with the
                    two games being cross-compatible with each other.[66][67]
                    [68] Sakurai stated that the announcement was made public in
                    order to attract developers needed for the games, as
                    development for the games did not start until May 2012 due
                    to production on Kid Icarus: Uprising.[69][70] On June 21,
                    2012, Nintendo announced that the creation of the games
                    would be a co-production between Sakurai's Sora Ltd. and
                    Bandai Namco Entertainment.[71] The games were officially
                    revealed at E3 2013, with new information being released via
                    trailers, Nintendo Direct presentations, and developer posts
                    on Miiverse.[72] The game features 58 characters,[73] 19 of
                    whom are new, and 7 of whom are downloadable. The game was
                    released for Nintendo 3DS in Japan in September 2014, and in
                    North America, Europe, and Australia the following month.
                    The Wii U version was released in North America, Europe, and
                    Australia in November 2014, and in Japan the following
                    month.[74][75][76]
