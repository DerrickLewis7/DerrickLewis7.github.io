                    Palette and Plate Gallery specializes in the combination of
                    art and culinary delicacies. We want to create an experience
                    when you eat here. Not just an ordinary meal you can have at
                    any other restaurant. Food is not just about taste. The
                    visual aspect is just as important and we prove that at
                    Palette and Plate Gallery.
